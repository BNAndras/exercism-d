Exercism exercises in the D Programming Language

## Filenames

Each exercise is identified by a slug.
The slug is all lower-case, and if it is multiple words, it is hyphenated.

E.g. `circular-buffer`.

The following conventions are used when adding a new exercise:

* Name the directory `$SLUG`
* Place the tests in `$SLUG.d`, replacing underscores with hyphens.
* Name the example solution `$SLUG_example`, replacing underscores with hyphens.

E.g.

```
$ tree exercises/circular-buffer
exercises/circular-buffer/
├── circular_buffer.d
└── circular_buffer_example.d

0 directories, 2 files
```
